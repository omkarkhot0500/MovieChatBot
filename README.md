# Movie Recommendation Chatbot ðŸŽ¬

## Overview
This project features a chatbot that provides personalized movie recommendations using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot identifies user intents, such as genre preferences or recent movie suggestions, and responds with appropriate movie recommendations. It combines NLP techniques with machine learning and a modern web interface built with Streamlit.
